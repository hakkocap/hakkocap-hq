# Strategy Report - 2026-02-23: Mobile Fleet & Data Plundering

## 1. Mobile Fleet - IP Refresh Simulation (Conceptual)

**Objective:** Simulate IP refresh logic for 4 Pixel phones via ADB Airplane Mode toggle, including a retry algorithm.

**Key Components:**
*   **ADB Commands:** `adb shell settings put global airplane_mode_on [1/0]`, `adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.AIRPLANE_MODE --ez state [true/false]`
*   **Simulation Logic:**
    *   Loop through devices (e.g., `Pixel_6_emulator`, `Pixel_7_emulator`, etc.).
    *   Get initial external IP (simulated or via `curl`).
    *   Toggle Airplane Mode ON, wait, then OFF.
    *   Wait for network re-establishment (`AIRPLANE_MODE_TOGGLE_DELAY = 15` seconds).
    *   Get new IP and compare.
*   **Retry Algorithm:**
    *   `MAX_IP_REFRESH_RETRIES = 5` attempts.
    *   If IP doesn't change, wait `RETRY_WAIT_BASE * retry_count` seconds before next attempt.
    *   Success criteria: IP successfully changes within retries.

**Conceptual Python Script:** (See attached `MobileFleet_IPRefreshSim.py` for detailed logic)
- Focuses on ADB command simulation and retry strategy.
- Uses `subprocess` for commands (in real execution) or simulated IP generation.

## 2. AI-Hub - Data Plundering Script Draft

**Objective:** Design a script for segmented download and metadata pre-selection extraction for a 1.17TB Robotics dataset, respecting mini PC resource limits (simulated 10% usage).

**Assumptions:**
*   Dataset accessible via segmented HTTP GET requests (`Range` header).
*   Metadata available in a JSON manifest.

**Script Design (`DataPlunder_Robotics.py`):**
*   **Segmented Download:**
    *   Uses `requests` with `stream=True` and `Range` headers.
    *   `download_part` function with retry logic (`RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3`, `RETRY_DELAY=10s`).
    *   `threading` and `queue` for efficient, resource-managed downloads (`MAX_THREADS=4`).
*   **Metadata Extraction:**
    *   `process_metadata` function fetches a manifest file and extracts entries based on criteria (e.g., tags like 'robotics', 'perception').
    *   Outputs to `SELECTED_METADATA_OUTPUT` (JSONL format for efficiency).
*   **Resource Management:** `MAX_THREADS` limits concurrency; streaming downloads reduce memory footprint.

## 3. Business Profitability Calculation (PC Business)

**System Setup:**
*   4x Used Pixel Phones
*   4x SIM cards with data plans
*   1x Mini PC for control

**Cost Analysis:**
*   **Initial Investment:**
    *   Phones (4 * 200,000 KRW): 800,000 KRW
    *   *Total Initial Investment: ~800,000 KRW*
*   **Monthly Running Costs:**
    *   SIM Maintenance (4 * 10,000 KRW): 40,000 KRW
    *   Mini PC Electricity (~100W * 24h * 30d * 0.15 KRW/kWh): ~10,800 KRW
    *   *Total Monthly Running Cost: ~50,800 KRW*

**Profitability & Break-Even Point (BEP):**
*   **Monthly Savings (from avoiding paid proxies):** 500,000 KRW
*   **Monthly Net Profit (Savings - Running Costs):** 500,000 KRW - 50,800 KRW = **449,200 KRW/month**
*   **BEP (Initial Investment Recovery):** Initial Investment / Monthly Net Profit = 800,000 KRW / 449,200 KRW/month ≈ **1.78 months**.
    *   *Conclusion: The system is projected to recoup its initial investment in approximately 2 months.*

**Estimated Daily Data Collection Volume:**
*   Highly dependent on source, network, and scraping success rate.
*   **Conservative Estimate:** ~15-50 GB/day. (Based on ~10MB/IP, 10min refresh, 24h cycle, ~100 MB data per IP cycle, potentially reaching ~15GB if successful). More aggressive targets are possible but increase risk.
